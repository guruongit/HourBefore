# HourBefore
HourBefore is a simulation project based on python. It is build to predict a save path for an airplane which is currently flying but lost all the communication from the ground or in a situation in which pilot does not know where to go or what move to take to insure passenger and all crews safty. This python program uses common logics, common airlines traditions and flight security protocols to predict a save path for nearly an hour flight time. If this program implemented universally for a entire state it can tell position, velocity, path etc, and all related parameters of all the flights in the sky of that state upto plus one hour.
